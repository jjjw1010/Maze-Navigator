    <h3>Summary </h3>  
      <p>
        The main goal of Lab 3 was to work on the audio aspect of "The Robot". The functionality of the 
        audio aspect of "The Robot" would be that during the final demo, "The Robot" would hear a melody
        that is being played and upon detecting a spectific trigger frequency, this is when "The Robot" knows
        it can start navigating through the maze.
       </p>
      <p> The workload of the Lab 3 was divided into two weeks: </p>
      <p></p>
      
      <p> In the first week, my lab partner and I focused on using LTSpice, simulating lowpass, highpass and bandpass passive filiters.
        We also focused on building the basic microphone circuit and testing it with MATLAB and the Nano. 
        We built the amplifier microphone circuit and tested it with MATLAB and the Nano. 
        Finally, we implemented a filiter, characterized it and compared it frequency response to our simulation result. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> In the second week, my lab partner and I tested our amplified microphone circuit only on the Nano (FFT on the Nano).
        We also characterize our circuit and adapted the code for the Final Demo. </p> 
      
      <p> In depth descriptions of what we did in each week is included in the picture descriptions. </p>

      <p> Figure 3. This is a picture of the Initial simple microphone circuit we built using a resistor value 4.02 kOhm and capacitor value of 0.22 uF
        , capacitor and the arduino. 
      The green wire connected to the microphone which is the round shaped object is connected to ground. The other terminal of the microphone
      is connected to the resistor and positive end of the capacitor. The other end of the resistor was connected to the green wire which is 
      hooked up to a 5V powered by the Arduino Nano Every. The other end of the capacitor is connected to the yellow wire which is hooked up 
      to the Analog pin of the Arduino Nano Every. </p>

      <p> Figure 4. My lab partner and I created an arduino code and a matlab code. The arduino code job was
        to receive sound from our computer that was generated from MATLAB and sound would be picked up by the arduino
        through the arduino code. The MATLAB code job, besides generating sound, was to get the data obtain from 
        the arduino and transfer over to matlab and plot the data nicely. This is the graph that we generated from MATLAB from passing a 500 frequency Hz sound into our
      basic microphone circuit. We can see a peak at around 487 Hz which is around 500 Hz of the input we had on the
      second graph shown in the picutre. In the first graph, it shows the duration of time we played the 500 Hz frequency from MATLAB
        through our computer speaker.  </p>

      <h3> Reflection </h3>
      
      <p> I believe this lab was the longest lab by far and also one of the interesting labs I worked with by far. Dealing with especially the coding components 
        was a struggle because sometimes the code won't run or just would take too long to run and you wouldn't be too sure where the error was really at
      and what you did wrong. However, I enjoyed the having the experience of the process of giving "The Robot" audio quality. </p>
