      <h3> Welcome to Junwoo Jung's Github Wiki for ECE 3400 </h3>
      <p> Four lab works would be posted here. The ultimate goal of these labs is to prepare for the Final Demo. </p>
      <h4> Final Demo </h4>
      <p> In the Final Demo, "The Robot" would have to explore through the maze where it would need to find 3 treasures which are blinking IR treasures each at 
        different frequenices. When the treasure is found, "The Robot" will measure the blinking frequency using a specific method and 
        will send the frequency to the base station wirelessly. The base station will display the frequency of the treasures as they are discovered.
        Exploration is timed until the last treasure is found and its frequency is displayed.
      </p>
      <h4> Labs in Preparation for Final Demo</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Lab 1: Arduino Intro, Servos & Ultrasonic Sensors</li>
        <li>Lab 2: Phototransistors & Displays</li>
        <li>Lab 3: Filtering & Fourier</li>
        <li>Lab 4: RF Comms & Navigation</li>
      </ul>
      <p> * Note : I refer to "The Robot" for the robot my partner and I used because the robot has not been named yet * </p>
